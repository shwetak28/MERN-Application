Introduction - 
This project is a sample application built using the MERN stack, designed to demonstrate the implementation of CRUD operations in a full-stack environment. The application leverages MongoDB for the database, Express for the server framework, React for the front end, and Node.js for server-side logic. Additionally, Mongoose is used for MongoDB object modeling, and EJS templates are employed for certain server-side rendered views.

Technologies Used - 
MongoDB (M): NoSQL database used for storing application data.
Express (E): Web framework for Node.js, handling server-side logic and routing.
React (R): JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js (N): JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
Sequel: Used in some backend management aspects.
EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates): Used for server-side rendering of HTML pages.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and modern web design.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
Postman: Tool for testing API endpoints.

Application Creation Process - 

This will include following 3 steps -

1. Setting Up the Database and Server -
Using Mongoose for MongoDB:
Mongoose is utilized to define the schema and model for the database.
Models and schemas are created to manage data efficiently.
Configuring the Server:
The server is set up using Node.js and Express.
Error management and response handling are implemented to ensure robust server operation.

2.Front End Development -
Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework:
Bootstrap is integrated to create responsive and aesthetically pleasing forms and UI components.
Create, Read, Update, and Delete Forms:
Forms are created to handle CRUD operations, allowing users to interact with the application data.
Setup of Routing and Navigation:
React Router is used to manage application routes and navigation.
Redirects and routes are configured to provide a seamless user experience.

3. Front End and Back End Connection -
API Calls via Axios:
Axios is used to handle HTTP requests between the front end and back end.
API calls are made to perform create, read, update, and delete operations.
UAM Processing:
User Authentication and Management (UAM) are implemented for secure access and data management.
Postman Testing:
Postman is used to test API endpoints and ensure correct functionality.
Update and Delete Operations:
Data prefill and editing features are added to allow users to update existing records.
Predefined responses are set up to provide feedback to users.

Recap and Conclusion - 

This sample MERN stack application demonstrates the following key features:
- Full implementation of CRUD operations.
- Real-time error handling and response management.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design using Bootstrap.
- Robust front-end and back-end integration using Axios and React Router.
- Secure data management and user authentication.
By following the steps and techniques outlined in this project, you can gain a solid understanding of building full-stack applications using the MERN stack. This application serves as a foundation for creating more complex and feature-rich web applications in the future.
